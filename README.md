# Miami Tech Company Analysis

Aletha Spang, Dr. Luis Alvarez Leon, and Ishika Jha, 2025.

The uploaded files contain code and information for our analysis on technology companies in Miami between 2019-2022. The files are as follows:
1. CGL_Tech_Company_Analysis.Rmd: an R notebook containing code that subsetted a list of tech companies from Crunchbase into different sectors, filtered by year, and eventually joined with the results of the fuzzy matching to local business tax records.
2. Fuzzy_Matching_Tech_Companies_Python.ipynb: a short Python script that reads in a table of tech companies from Crunchbase and our literature review and conducts fuzzy matching with the local business tax record database.
3. CGL_Property_Sales_Miami_Analysis.Rmd: an R notebook containing code that aggregated property sales points into Miami neighborhoods and created graphs for analysis.
